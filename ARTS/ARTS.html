<h1>ARTS: Automated Root-Cause Labelling of Incidents using a Large-Scale Taxonomy in Microsoft Azure</h1>
<h2>ARTS - Azure Reliability Tagging System</h2>
<p>ARTS (Azure Reliability Tagging System) is a hierarchical taxonomy of root-cause tags used to label production incidents of Azure services. Such labelling enables aggregating rootcause categories to identify problem areas, trends, patterns, and risks that may lead to future incidents.</p>
<p>The ARTS taxonomy is <em>comprehensive</em>---it includes many different factors contributing towards thousands of production incidents in Azure, and yet <em>compact</em> enough---it contains only the rootcauses observed in real incidents. The taxonomy has been developed over last few years and is still growing (slowly) as new rootcauses are discovered.</p>
<h3><a href="taxonomy.html">ARTS Taxonomy</a></h3>
<p>The ARTS taxonomy can be <a href="taxonomy.html">visualized here</a>. Each node in the hierarchical taxonomy shows a rootcause category and it can be clicked to expand its sub-categories (if any). Moreover, hovering the mouse over a node shows a short description of the category.</p>
<p>A CSV file containing the taxonomy can be found <a href="taxonomy.csv">here</a>..</p>
<h2>Automatic labelling with ARTS</h2>
<p>One can manually label a post-incident report (PIR) with relevant ARTS tags. However, such manual labelling does not scale well and can be inconsistence/error-prone.</p>
<p>To address this, we have developed automated ML-based techniques to analyze the content of a PIR in order to (1) recommend ARTS tags relevant to the PIR, and (2) a small snippet of texts (from the long PIR) that capture the rootcauses explaining the recommended tags. The work is currently under submission; please email <span style="text-decoration: underline;">sumann at microsoft dot com</span> if you are interested in the details.</p>
